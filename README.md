# Telescope Through Time: Interactive Astronomical Calendar

## ðŸŒŒ Project Overview

Telescope Through Time is an innovative web application designed to make astronomical education interactive and engaging. It visualizes 365 stars in a spiral galaxy formation, each representing a day of the year, allowing users to explore real astronomical events through an immersive virtual telescope interface.

## âœ¨ Website Functionality and Unique Features

This application offers a unique way to discover the cosmos with its blend of interactive design and real-time data:

*   *Interactive Celestial Calendar*: Each star in the virtual galaxy corresponds to a specific date in the year (MM-DD format), providing a dynamic astronomical calendar where users can uncover daily space events, missions, and celestial phenomena.
*   *Virtual Telescope Experience*: Users can navigate through the galaxy using a draggable telescope viewport, complete with crosshairs, zoom controls, and coordinate tracking, simulating an authentic astronomical observation.
*   *Real-Time Event Discovery Engine*: Each star fetches real astronomical events for its corresponding date from the NASA API. Events are categorized (Stars, Planets, Comets, Space Missions) and include fascinating facts and links to authoritative astronomy sources.
*   *Advanced Filtering & Controls*: Users can filter stars by event type, adjust zoom levels (1x to 5x magnification), and observe visual indicators (blue stars for events, selected stars with a golden glow).
*   *Dual Navigation Methods*: Explore by directly clicking stars in the galaxy or by using a collapsible monthly calendar for date-specific navigation. Calendar selections automatically center the telescope on the corresponding star.
*   *Responsive Design*: Optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
*   *Authentic Visuals*: Features deep slate backgrounds, stellar gradients, and smooth animations to create an immersive space theme.
